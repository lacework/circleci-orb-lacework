  This example runs a container vulnerability scan using the ctr-vuln-scan job,
  it will generate the container vulnerability assessment in HTML format,
  store the artifact automatically, and cause the pipeline to fail by returning
  a non-zero exit code when fixable vulnerabilities are returned by the scan.
